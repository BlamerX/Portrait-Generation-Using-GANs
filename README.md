## About Dataset

I have used this dataset as It has only 10k+ images. This was a Subset of the [Oiginal dataset](https://academictorrents.com/details/1d154cde2fab9ec8039becd03d9bb877614d351b) also on [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipythonx/wikiart-gangogh-creating-art-gan) but as i had to train for long and the time constraint i had to go with this as it is a really great dataset.
